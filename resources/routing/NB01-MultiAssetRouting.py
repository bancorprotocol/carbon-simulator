# # Multi Asset Routing [NB01]
#
# This code is inspired by the paper and code from "Optimal Routing for Constant Function Market Makers" (Angeris et al 2022) [[arxiv][arx], [code][pcode]]. It requires [`cvxpy`][cvxpy] which is not a standard install on Conda, but can be installed using `pip`. This notebook also requires the `carbon` library from the [Carbon Simulator][sim] available for import.

# ## Scenario
#
# Here we create the a randomized market scenario. The keys of the `prices` dict are the tokens in the system, and the value is the price in an arbitrary numeraire. We recommend that one of the tokens is the cash token, and that therefore its price is one, but this is not necessary. The constant `N` determines how many curves are generated _per pair_, and the `_rg` determine the random parameters, as detailed in the comments below.

prices = dict(
    USDC=1,
    LINK=5,
    ETH=2000,
    WBTC=20000,
)
N = 4        # number of curves per pool
krg = 2      # pool constant k; eg 2 = 0.5 .. 2x
prg = 0.2    # price; eg 0.2 = plus/minus 20%
wrg = 0.2    # price range width; eg 0.2 = plus/minus 20%

            print(f"{pair}: {ptkn12}")
            for i in range(N):
                price = ptkn12*CC.u(1-prg, 1+prg)
                k = 10000**2/ptkn1/ptkn2*CC.u(1/krg, krg)

# ## Optimization


# This code runs the actual optimization. It has two major parts
#
# 1. the **constraints**, and 
# 2. the **objective function** to be optimized (min or max)
#
# The objective function is to either maximize the number of tokens received from the AMM (which is a negative number, hence formally the condition is `cp.Minimize` or to minimize the number of tokens paid to the AMM which is a positive number. Therefore `cp.Minimize` is the correct choice in each case.
#
# The constraints come in three types:
#
# - **curve constraint**: the curve constraints correspond to the $x\cdot y=k$ invariant of the respective AMM; the constraint is formally `>=` but it has been shown eg by Angeris et al that the constraint will always be optimal on the boundary
#
# - **range constraints**: the range constraints correspond to the tokens actually available on curve; for the full-curve AMM those constraints would formally be `dx >= -c.x` and the same for `y`, but those constraint are automatically fulfilled because of the asymptotic behaviour of the curves so could be omitted
#
# - **self-financing constraints**: the self-financing constraints corresponds to the condition that all `dx` and `dy` corresponding to a specific token other than the token in the objective function must sum to the target amount provided in `inputs` (or zero if not provided)

# +

)

# run the optimization
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
result = problem.solve(verbose=False)  
print(f"r={result:.2f}")


# -

# ## Results

# The `status` field shows whether the optimization succeeded. Everything else than `optimal` is, well, not optimal. The `result` field corresponds to the achieved objective function. A negative number corresponds to the AMM paying out this amount, a positive number to the AMM receiving it. The token is also provided. The `dx` and `dy` fields finally corresponds to the trade actions of the individual AMMs finally.

# ### Graphical results
#
# The charts below corrspond to the charts above, the sole difference being the addition of the round marker indicating the new state of the AMM. In an unconstraint environment they should line up on a straight line going through the origin.
