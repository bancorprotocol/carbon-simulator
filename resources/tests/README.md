# Passed Tests

Those tests have passed at one stage during the development process. They form a relatively complete body of examples what the library can do. However, they may no longer run. And, unless the `Carbon` library has been installed locally, they wont run from this location.

The tests require the `jupyformat.py` file for the big colored messages.
