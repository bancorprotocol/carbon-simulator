# IGSTATE (Ignore state)

:purpose:   change the simplified analytics to now take the curve state
            into account (ie rather than assuming y=yint use the actual y)
:status:    not clear; it looks like the interface code is there, but the
            code for the general case is not working; also there is the 
            Test 36/2 book, but it is not clear how it differs from Test 36
