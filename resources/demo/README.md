# Carbon Library

The executables in this directory need a local copy of the `carbon` library to run. In order to install this we recommend to use symbolic links as follows


    cd [thisdir]
    ln -s ../../carbon carbon

You must then also add the following line to the `.gitignore` file 

    [thisdir]/carbon
